# Heart-Disease-Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning to predict cardiovascular disease based on key risk factors. Cardiovascular disease is a leading global cause of preventable deaths, responsible for significant suffering and straining healthcare systems. It claims about 17.7 million lives annually, making up 44% of non-communicable disease fatalities.

We monitor risk factors such as blood pressure, obesity, age, gender, diet, exercise, smoking, insurance, mental and physical health, alcohol use, sleep, and health check-ups. Our aim is to leverage machine learning techniques for accurate disease prediction, contributing to research and prevention efforts. Below is an organized breakdown of the project's key components and features:

### Data Preprocessing

Before diving into machine learning models, it's essential to preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. The following steps have been taken:

1. **Resampling Techniques:** 
   - Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbours (Undersampling)
   - Random Over Sampler (Oversampling)

2. **Standardization**

3. **Feature Selection:** 
   - Recursive Feature Elimination

### Machine Learning Models

Here are the models implemented:

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**

2. **Logistic Regression**

3. **Support Vector Machine**

### Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of the machine learning models, the following evaluation metrics have been utilized:

1. **Precision**

2. **Recall**

3. **F1-Score**

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Fine-tuning the model parameters is crucial for achieving better performances.

1. **Grid Search**
